## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Edit a room's name, topic, and photo.** A new ⚙ button in the room header opens a
  **Room settings** dialog to change the room's name, topic, and avatar. Fields you don't
  have permission to change (by power level) are read-only. Changes save to `m.room.name`
  / `m.room.topic` / `m.room.avatar` and sync across clients.
- **Moderators can delete others' messages.** If your power level in a room meets its
  redaction requirement (a moderator or admin), the message ⋯ menu now offers **Delete
  message** on other people's messages too, not just your own — redacting them for
  everyone. Regular members still only see it on their own messages.
- **Leave a room.** Each room's ⋮ menu in the channel list now has a **Leave room**
  action: confirm, and you leave the room and it drops out of your list. Previously you
  could unlink a room from a space or decline an invite, but there was no way to exit a
  joined room. If the room you leave is the one open, the timeline pane clears.
- **App version and commit in Settings.** The Settings screen now shows the running
  build's version and git commit in a small footer (e.g. `Trinity v0.0.1 · a1b2c3d`),
  regenerated from `package.json` + git at build time — handy for bug reports.
- **Polls.** Create a poll from the composer (a question with two to eight answers),
  and it renders in the timeline with a share bar per option and a live vote tally.
  Tap an answer to vote (or change your vote); the poll's creator can end it, after
  which the results are final. Built on the Matrix poll events (MSC3381), so it
  interoperates with other clients.
- **Forward messages to another conversation.** The message overflow menu now has a
  **Forward** action: pick a room or direct message from the switcher and the message
  is re-sent there as a standalone message. Works for text and media (including in
  encrypted rooms, since an attachment carries its own key), from rooms and threads.
- **"Seen by" read receipts.** Messages now show small avatars of the members who have
  read up to them, updating live as people catch up — so you can tell who's seen what.
- **In-app navigation for Matrix links.** Clicking a `matrix.to` link in a message now
  stays in Trinity: a room link opens that room (resolving an alias and jumping to a
  linked message), and a person link (including a mention) opens a small profile card —
  avatar, name, online status, and a **Message** button to start a direct message.
  Ordinary web links open in a new tab instead of navigating away from the app.
- **Per-room notification level.** Each room's ⋮ menu in the channel list has a
  **Notifications** submenu to set how a room notifies you — **All messages**, **Mentions &
  keywords only**, or **Mute** — persisted as Matrix push rules so it follows you across
  devices. Muting suppresses even mentions; mentions-only keeps highlight pings while
  silencing everything else.
- **"New messages" divider and jump-to-unread.** Trinity now persists a fully-read
  marker (`m.fully_read`) alongside the read receipt, so returning to a busy room shows a
  "New messages" divider at exactly where you left off — and, when that divider is
  scrolled out of view, a "↑ New messages" pill that jumps you straight to it. The
  divider stays put for the visit even as new messages are marked read, and the marker
  now survives reloads and syncs across your devices.
- **Set your own presence and status.** A new **Settings → Presence** section lets you
  publish your online state — Online, Away, or Offline — and an optional status message,
  the counterpart to the presence dots already shown for other people. Homeservers that
  disable or rate-limit presence are handled gracefully.
- **Spoilers are now hidden until you reveal them.** Messages containing spoiler
  content (`data-mx-spoiler`) previously showed it in the clear; it now renders as a
  black bar that you click — or focus and press Enter/Space — to uncover. A first click
  that lands on a link inside a spoiler only reveals it rather than following the link.
- **React with any emoji.** The message reaction popover kept only six quick emoji;
  a new "+" button now opens the full emoji picker (search included), so you can react
  with anything — in rooms and threads alike. The six one-tap reactions stay as a fast path.
- **Typing indicators.** The composer now tells the room when you're typing, and an
  "X is typing…" row appears under the timeline when other members type — naming up to
  three of them and summarising beyond that. It clears the moment they send or stop, and
  Trinity stops advertising your own typing as soon as you send or leave the room.
- **@-mention people from the composer.** Type `@` and a name to pick a room member
  from an autocomplete menu; the sent message links them and, crucially, carries
  `m.mentions` so they're actually notified — including replies, which now ping the
  message's author. Works in rooms and threads, for new messages, replies, and edits.
- **Message drafts are kept per conversation.** A half-typed message now stays with
  its room (or thread) when you switch away and comes back when you return, and it
  survives a reload or app restart. Previously the composer was shared across rooms,
  so an unsent message bled into the next room you opened and was lost on reload.
- **Settings, reorganised into a browsable submenu.** The settings screen is now a
  menu of sections — **Profile**, **Appearance**, **Devices**, **GIFs**, and
  **Experimental** — each on its own page. On desktop the menu and the selected
  section sit side by side (two-pane); on mobile the menu is the entry point and
  tapping a section opens it, with a back button returning to the list. Deep links and
  reloads land on the exact section, and back leaves settings in one press rather than
  retracing the sections you visited. The profile picture is now changed from a camera
  badge tucked into the corner of the avatar rather than a separate button.
- **Multiple accounts, signed in at once.** Sign into several Matrix accounts and keep
  them all syncing concurrently. Switch the active account from the user panel in the
  channel sidebar (which lists each account with its own unread count and marks the
  active one), add another via **Add account**, and sign accounts out individually. The
  app-icon badge now sums unread across every account, and desktop/web notifications
  fire for background accounts too — tapping one switches to the owning account before
  opening the room. On mobile, each account registers its own push pusher tagged with
  its user id (full per-account push delivery also needs a push-gateway change — see
  `docs/PUSH.md`). Each account gets an isolated encryption (crypto) store, so accounts
  never share keys.
- **Graceful handling of a revoked session, with re-authentication.** If a homeserver
  signs one account out (its access token is revoked server-side), the other accounts
  keep running: a soft logout keeps that account's data, and it appears in the account
  switcher as "Signed out — Sign in" so you can re-authenticate it in place (reusing its
  existing device, so no re-verification), while a hard logout wipes it. Losing your last
  account returns you to the login screen instead of a broken shell.
- **Persistent local storage.** Trinity now asks the browser to keep its on-device
  data (each account's message-sync and encryption stores) persistent so it isn't
  evicted under storage pressure — which matters more as accounts add up, since an
  evicted encryption store would force that account to re-verify.
- **Send GIFs from the composer.** A new GIF button (beside the emoji picker) opens a
  searchable GIF grid — trending on open, live search as you type — and sends the chosen
  GIF as an image message in rooms and threads (encrypted rooms included). Search is
  powered by **Tenor** or **GIPHY**: pick a provider and paste a free API key in
  Settings → GIFs. The GIF button stays hidden until a key is configured.
- **Online status for members and direct messages.** The room member list now
  reflects each member's Matrix presence: a coloured dot on their avatar (green
  online, amber away, grey offline), with online members ordered first and offline
  members dimmed. Each direct-message row in the sidebar also shows the other
  person's status on their avatar. All updating live. The presence dot is built
  into the shared avatar component.
- **Role sections in the member list.** The room member list now groups members
  under **Admin**, **Moderator**, and **Member** headers (derived from each member's
  power level, the same 100/50 convention Element uses), each header showing that
  role's count. The panel leads straight into these sections. Empty roles are hidden,
  online-first ordering and the offline dimming are kept within every section, and a
  promotion or demotion re-sorts the list live.

### Changed

- **Restructured the Nx workspace into typed, per-domain libraries.** The monolithic
  `@trinity/core` lib was dissolved into `@trinity/util-matrix` (pure DI-free models/
  helpers), `@trinity/platform-native` (Capacitor/native capabilities), and per-domain
  `@trinity/data-access-*` libs over the shared `@trinity/data-access-matrix-client`
  foundation. The app shell moved to `@trinity/feature-shell`, leaving `apps/trinity` as
  bootstrap + routing only. `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` now enforces a typed
  dependency ladder (`app → feature → {data-access, ui} → {util, platform}`, features
  never depend on features) plus a `scope:shared` / `scope:matrix` split so the kernel
  stays domain-agnostic. Consumers import the specific lib instead of `@trinity/core`.
- Migrated the unit test suite to `@testing-library/angular` (`render`) + `ng-mocks`
  (`MockProvider`/`MockComponent`).
- Slimmed oversized component input/output surfaces (channel-sidebar, message-row +
  message-toolbar, media-bubble, server-rail) — grouping related inputs into view-model
  objects, reading core signals directly, and collapsing the message-action outputs into
  one typed event.
- Moved all inline component templates into sibling `.html` `templateUrl` files.

### Fixed

- **Links in messages are now clickable.** A bare URL in a message rendered as plain
  text — because a plain-text message (no HTML formatting) wasn't linkified. URLs are
  now turned into links when a message is displayed, so they're clickable regardless of
  whether the sender's client included formatted HTML, and they open in a new tab.
- New sessions now register with the device name **Trinity** instead of the stale
  **Trinity (Ionic)** — the app no longer runs on Ionic, so the label shown in
  Settings → Devices (and to other Matrix clients) shouldn't advertise it.
- Hardened the room and thread send paths (messages, attachments, edits, replies,
  reactions, redactions): each now resolves the active account and the open room at the
  moment the send runs, rather than when it is created. Nothing in the app could trigger
  the old behaviour today, but it closed a latent path for a send to land on an account
  you had just switched away from — or to upload unencrypted bytes into a room that had
  become encrypted in the meantime.
- Clearing your GIF API key no longer forgets which GIF provider you had chosen. Settings
  → GIFs stored the provider and the key together, so **Clear** discarded both and the next
  time you opened the app the provider had silently reverted to Tenor. GIPHY users now stay
  on GIPHY after clearing their key.
- Signing an account out and then logging back in failed with a crypto error ("the account
  in the store doesn't match the account in the constructor"), leaving that account unable to
  sign back in. Sign-out wiped the account's message cache but deleted the wrong encryption
  store, so its real one was left behind; because the store was keyed only by user, the next
  login (which gets a fresh device from the server) reopened that stale store and refused to
  start. Two fixes: sign-out now deletes the correct encryption store, and each login's
  encryption store is now scoped to its device, so a fresh login always starts clean instead
  of reopening an old device's store. This also recovers accounts that were already stuck.
  Re-logging in on a new device without signing out first now also cleans up the previous
  device's leftover encryption store instead of leaving it on disk, and on startup any
  encryption stores orphaned by earlier versions are swept away to reclaim disk space.
- OnPush re-render regression on the message timeline: per-row caps are now memoized so
  scrolling/typing no longer re-renders every visible row and its toolbar.

### Removed

- Leftover Ionic `--ion-*` CSS custom properties (dead since the UI moved to spartan-ng);
  the dark-mode class `.ion-palette-dark` was renamed to `.dark`.
